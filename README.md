### 🐑 Greetings and welcome! 

Data Engineer during the day, overworked student at night.

I work daily with: MS Azure Services, Databases, Parallel Computing, and Python notebooks.
Passion domain is Mobile Apps Development (currently working on a cool app for my diploma project!).
Not a fan of web dev :P

You'll find diverse fauna on my page and I don't intend to have it any other way.
