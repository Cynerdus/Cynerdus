### 🐑 Greetings and welcome! 

Data Engineer during the day, overworked student at night.

I work daily with: MS Azure Services, Databases, Parallel Computing, and Python notebooks. \
Passion domain is Mobile Apps Development (currently working on a cool app for my diploma project!). \
I teach slightly younger students OOP principles in Java. \
Took part in multiple competitive programming/innovation competitions when I had the time. \
Not a fan of web dev :P

You'll find diverse fauna on my page and I don't intend to have it any other way.
